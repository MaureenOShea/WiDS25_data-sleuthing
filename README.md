# Data Sleuthing: Investigating the Headlines with Python

Step into the role of a **data detective** in this interactive workshop. This project is about going *beyond the headlines* using Python and a Google Colab notebook to uncover insights hiding in plain sight.

## What You'll Do

In this hands-on workshop, you will:

- Use Python in a Google Colab notebook
- Work with **news-reported data**
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- **Clean and prepare** messy real-world datasets
- Ask meaningful questions to guide your analysis
- Uncover patterns, **identify trends**, and surface **hidden insights**
- Sharpen your analytical thinking and storytelling skills

Whether you're looking to refine your existing skills or build confidence in your data workflow, this workshop gives you **practical tools** to become a more effective and curious data sleuth.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, matplotlib / seaborn, and other standard data science libraries
